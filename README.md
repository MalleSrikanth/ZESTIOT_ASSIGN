YOLO_OBJECT DETECTION USING KERAS 

Here Car detection model is trained with YOLO_keras 

Mainly 
* create dataset
* Annotate data
* convert cvs files into YOLO format 
* Download pre trained weights 
* Convert YOLOV3 weights into keras format
* Adjust epochs , batch_size in train.py file 
* train model running  train.py
* Check its loss is decreasing , else stop and adjust learning rate , batch_size 
* After running model , test on image using image_detect.py

That's it YOlO model runned on custom data .....
